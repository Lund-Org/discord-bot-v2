Another feature :
A meme channel is created or the bot attached to one depending on the env variable (see below)

The meme channel accepts urls finishing by .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png and .bmp, the message with an image (and no text) or the link from the whitelist which is tenor.com, giphy.com, imgur.com and twitter.com.

## Initialization of the project

#### How to create and add the bot to your server

Go to your [discord applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create a new app
Find your bot token in the bot menu
To make your bot join your server, go in the OAuth menu
Check "Bot"
In the url provided, replace `permissions=0` to `permissions=122406693968`
Your url should look like `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your client id>&permissions=122406693968&scope=bot%20applications.commands`
âš  Be careful to have the `applications.commands` in the scope
Copy the url and use it to add the bot to your server

#### Setup the channel ids

When we notify for some feature or monitor a channel, we need their channel id. They are set in the DiscordNotificationChannel table of the database. You have 6 cases :

- BIRTHDAY : The channel where the birthday wish will be done
- MEME : The meme channel we are monitoring to check the messages
- SHOP : The shop channel for the gacha where the threads are created

To enable the developper mode in your settings, then right click on the channel and copy the id
